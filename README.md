**Description :**

This project, supported by IIT Palakkad, tackles the critical issue of train-animal collisions through the integration of advanced AI and IoT technologies. The system employs real-time animal detection using high-resolution cameras and thermal imaging mounted on moving trains to accurately identify animals on the tracks. Once detected, it emits species-specific deterrence frequencies to safely redirect the animals away from the tracks. This innovative approach ensures the safety of wildlife while maintaining uninterrupted train operations, significantly reducing delays and associated costs.

**KEY FEATURES :
**
Animal Detection:
Detects animals near train tracks using advanced cameras and thermal imaging.

Animal Deterrence:
Emits specific frequencies to safely deter animals based on species.

Cost-Effective Solution:
Requires only one device per train, reducing overall costs.

**TECH STACK 
**
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow
Computer Vision: OpenCV, PIL
Data Analysis & Visualization: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn
Hardware Integration: Thermal imaging cameras and sensors

**IMPACT :
**
The system minimizes train delays, ensures animal safety, and reduces operational costs by preventing collisions effectively and efficiently.
